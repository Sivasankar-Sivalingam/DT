# Project DT

Project DT is an angular application build to maintain and hold entries for DT.

Project DT has been build on MEAN architecture. Where the Database is run through [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com), Middleware and Server is run through  [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) and  [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com), while the frontend and business manipulation is done through  [Angular](https://angular.io).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Steps to run Project DT 

1. GitClone or Download the [Project DT](https://github.com/Sivasankar-Sivalingam/DT).

2. To start with an angular application, we are going to need node.js. So the first step is to install node.js. We can get that installed from the below website: https://nodejs.org/en/

3. After installing NodeJs, Open the node.js command prompt.

4. Get into the project folder. i.e, run the cmd `cd  project_folder_path`.

5. Now install all the dependecies and devDependencies for the project by running the cmd `npm install`, this will intrun create a folder `node_modules` in the project structure and it will contain all the dependent files.

6. Now the Project DT - Angular app is ready to run. But still we need to run the server and DB to get the app run functionaly. So now we need to refer to the server app: [DT-Server](https://github.com/Sivasankar-Sivalingam/DT-Server) and follow the instructions to get it up and running. 

7. Run the cmd `npm start` form the Project DT. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The Project DT app will up and runnning in that URL and it will be automatically reloaded if you change is done in any of the source files.


## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a DT server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
